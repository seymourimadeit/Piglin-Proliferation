- Added configs for buckler description and critical aura
- Added configs for max ring duration and level (uncapped by default)
- Fixed issue with fire rings not properly emitting if Lithium was installed

    - Cobblestone Fire Rings will have a new model
- Fire rings now have colored fire and smoke based off of the potion it's emitting
- Renamed fire ring to Alchemical Fire Pit
