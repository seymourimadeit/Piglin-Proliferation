CHANGELOG:
- [CHANGE] - Changed 'in water' wording in buckler description to 'if wet' to prevent further confusion

- [CHANGE] - fix #50 (rare crash where crossbow alchemist piglins can't find a target)
- [CHANGE] - nerf spawn size for alchemists and potion drop chance

- spawn size is 1 to 3 instead of 3 to 6
